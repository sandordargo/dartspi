# Calculate Pi number using a target and darts:

- You have a squared wood panel which is 1x1 meter
- Inside that panel, is drawn a circle that is 1 meter wide (diameter = 1 meter)
- Throw 100 or more arrows inside that panel, in random positions
- Calculate the ratio of darts which are inside the target, over the amount you thrown
- Using a formula you'll easily find in the internet, calculate Pi using that ratio
